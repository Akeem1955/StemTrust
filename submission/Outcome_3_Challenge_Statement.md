# Outcome 3: Draft Challenge / Problem Statement

In Nigeria's Stem ecosystem, promising scientific research is systematically stifled by **opaque funding pathways** and a deep **deficit of trust** between donors and researchers.

This matters because while funding exists locally and internationally, the lack of transparency prevents it from reaching the innovators who solve our critical food, health, and environmental challenges.

An opportunity is emerging to use **transparent, immutable technology** to bridge this trust gap, allowing direct, verified funding to reach researchers and ensuring that Nigerian science can stay in Nigeria.
