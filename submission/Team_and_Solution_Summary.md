## 💡 Solution Summary: StemTrust (ScienceTrust Nigeria)

**StemTrust** is a blockchain-powered funding platform designed to restore trust in the Nigerian STEM research ecosystem.

### The Problem
Research funding in Nigeria is plagued by:
1.  **Opacity:** Donors cannot see how funds are utilized.
2.  **Delays:** Bureaucratic "processing" times of 6-18 months kill innovation.
3.  **Trust Deficit:** A lack of verifiable outcomes leads to reduced funding opportunities.

### The Solution
We provide a transparent, milestone-based funding mechanism using the **Cardano** blockchain.
*   **Smart Lock:** Funds are locked in smart contracts, not personal accounts.
*   **Milestone Release:** Funds are released only when researchers submit evidence (photos, data) that is approved by the community/funder (75% vote).
*   **Direct Access:** Bypasses administrative bottlenecks, connecting funders directly to verified researchers.

**Technology:** React (Frontend), Node.js (Backend), Cardano/MeshSDK/Aiken (Blockchain).
